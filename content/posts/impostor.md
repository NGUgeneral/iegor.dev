# About the impostor, the growth, and holding to your guns

### The Validation

I have to admit—when I first conceived the initial draft of Slim Jim, I got really excited. It was supposed to be a tool with "as few dependencies as possible, as long as it remains maintainable over the long term." I did some research into similar implementations, but I didn't dig vigorously enough.

Recently, I looked under the hood of xhtml2pdf and my stomach completely dropped.

"Damn! I just reverse-engineered an existing industry standard from scratch. I am a total fraud."

I was ashamed and angry with myself. Impostor syndrome immediately took the wheel. After yelling from the rooftops about Slim Jim and its high-stress benchmarks (1,000 PDFs in 1.6 seconds), I felt like an absolute fool who had just spent weeks reinventing the wheel.

But then I forced myself to stop, breathe out, and look at the facts:  
1. I didn't copy a blueprint.  
2. I targeted a specific performance bottleneck.  
3. I independently arrived at the exact design pattern used by production-grade software.  

That isn't a failure—that is a massive validation of architectural instincts. If your clean-slate design perfectly mirrors a proven industry standard (and runs with brutal efficiency), you didn't fail. You succeeded.

### The Impostor

It is highly interesting, though, how impostor syndrome catches us at our lowest. When we are juniors, we think impostor syndrome disappears once we put on the "big boy suit" and get a Lead or Architect title. It doesn't.

It is very easy to receive negative feedback, take it close to heart, and wear that description of yourself as a new identity—an undervalued, belittled failure. Even if the feedback is valid, it does not reflect you as a whole person; it is nothing more than a snapshot of a professional who made a mistake. It is not a call to action to take off your "Seasoned Professional Suit" and expose the fraud you are underneath—because you aren't one.

As we mature, the inner impostor stays, but the way we handle him changes. We don’t just take the hit. We hold to our guns and argue back with data. The more grounded and objective our arguments are against that voice, the more secure we become in our craft.

### Slim Jim's Post-Mortem

So, this is a "post-mortem" for Slim Jim as the next big thing: it is highly applicable for a large niche of use cases (think invoices, orders, or stickers). It will shine there, and I am confident it will outperform xhtml2pdf simply because, while relying on the same core logic, it omits so many edge cases that fall outside the scope of its responsibility.

However, at that scale, whether a system generates 600 files per second or 300 doesn't matter enough to be a critical concern—even if we frame it as a "100% more efficient solution!"

I will keep using it in my personal projects because it keeps me from relying on a "black box." It brings me as close to bare PDF byte manipulation as possible, allowing me to fine-tune it exactly as I want. Slim Jim turned out to be a big win for me—just a different kind of win than I originally envisioned.

I see no scenario where an enterprise would choose Slim Jim over a massive library like xhtml2pdf, and that is absolutely fine.

Welp, let's move on then.
